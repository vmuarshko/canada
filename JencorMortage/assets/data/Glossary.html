<strong>Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)</strong> <br />
CMHC is a federal Crown corporation that administers the National Housing Act (NHA). Among other services, they also insure mortgages for lenders that are greater than 80% of the purchase price or value of the home. The cost of that insurance is paid for by the borrower and is generally added to the mortgage amount. These mortgages are often referred to as "Hi-Ratio" mortgages.<br />
<br />
<strong>Closed Mortgage</strong> <br />
A mortgage that cannot be prepaid or renegotiated for a set period of time without penalties.<br />
<br />
<strong>Closing Date</strong> <br />
The date on which the new owner takes possession of the property and the sale becomes final.<br />
<br />
<strong>Collateral</strong> <br />
An asset, such as term deposit, Canada Savings Bond, or automobile, that you offer as security for a loan.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conventional Mortgage</strong> <br />

If a house does not close because of the purchaser's failure to comply with the terms set out in the offer, the purchaser forgoes the deposit, and it is given to the vendor as compensation for the breaking of the contract (the offer).<br />
